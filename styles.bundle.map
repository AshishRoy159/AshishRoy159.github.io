See a full list of available properties in {\\@link AbstractControl}.\n *\n * **Set the value**: You can set an initial value for each child control when instantiating\n * the {\\@link FormArray}, or you can set the value programmatically later using the\n * {\\@link FormArray}'s {\\@link AbstractControl.setValue} or {\\@link AbstractControl.patchValue}\n * methods.\n *\n * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the array, you can\n * subscribe to the {\\@link FormArray}'s {\\@link AbstractControl.valueChanges} event.  You can also\n * listen to its {\\@link AbstractControl.statusChanges} event to be notified when the validation\n * status is re-calculated.\n *\n * **Add new controls**: You can add new controls to the {\\@link FormArray} dynamically by\n * calling its {\\@link FormArray.push} method.\n *  Ex: `this.form.get('cities').push(new FormControl());`\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/nestedFormArray/nested_form_array_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * * **NgModule**: `ReactiveFormsModule`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nexport var FormArrayName = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormArrayName, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} parent\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     */\n    function FormArrayName(parent, validators, asyncValidators) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        this._parent = parent;\n        this._validators = validators;\n        this._asyncValidators = asyncValidators;\n    }\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArrayName.prototype.ngOnInit = function () {\n        this._checkParentType();\n        this.formDirective.addFormArray(this);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArrayName.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () {\n        if (this.formDirective) {\n            this.formDirective.removeFormArray(this);\n        }\n    };\n    Object.defineProperty(FormArrayName.prototype, \"control\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this.formDirective.getFormArray(this); },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(FormArrayName.prototype, \"formDirective\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () {\n            return this._parent ?

Like in the former example, you have the\n * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nexport var SelectControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _renderer\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\n     */\n    function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        /** @internal */\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._idCounter = 0;\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\n        this.value = value;\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = this._getOptionId(value);\n        if (id == null) {\n            this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'selectedIndex', -1);\n        }\n        var /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(id, value);\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.onChange = function (valueString) {\n            _this.value = valueString;\n            fn(_this._getOptionValue(valueString));\n        };\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn; };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} isDisabled\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.setDisabledState = function (isDisabled) {\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'disabled', isDisabled);\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._registerOption = function () { return (this._idCounter++).toString(); };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionId = function (value) {\n        for (var _i = 0, _a = Array.from(this._optionMap.keys()); _i < _a.length; _i++) {\n            var id = _a[_i];\n            if (looseIdentical(this._optionMap.get(id), value))\n                return id;\n        }\n        return null;\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} valueString\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionValue = function (valueString) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = _extractId(valueString);\n        return this._optionMap.has(id) ?

For example, if one of\n * the controls in a `FormArray` is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.\n *\n * `FormArray` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,\n * along with {\\@link FormControl} and {\\@link FormGroup}.\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * When instantiating a {\\@link FormArray}, pass in an array of child controls as the first\n * argument.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * ```\n * const arr = new FormArray([\n *   new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   new FormControl('Drew'),\n * ]);\n *\n * console.log(arr.value);   // ['Nancy', 'Drew']\n * console.log(arr.status);  // 'VALID'\n * ```\n *\n * You can also include array-level validators as the second arg, or array-level async\n * validators as the third arg.

If used\n * within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child\n * control.\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * This directive can be used by itself or as part of a larger form. All you need is the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n *\n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\\@link \\@Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n * the domain model in your class as well.\n *\n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\\@link FormControl} (like\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n * full list of properties directly available in {\\@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n *\n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n *\n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n *\n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\n *\n * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n *\n * * Radio buttons: {\\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n * * Selects: {\\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n *\n * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n *\n *  \\@stable\n */\nexport var NgModel = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgModel, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} parent\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     * @param {?} valueAccessors\n     */\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        /** @internal */\n        this._control = new FormControl();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._registered = false;\n        this.update = new EventEmitter();\n        this._parent = parent;\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(this, valueAccessors);\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        this._checkForErrors();\n        if (!this._registered)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n            this._updateDisabled(changes);\n        }\n        if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this._updateValue(this.model);\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); };\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"control\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._control; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"path\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () {\n            return this._parent ?

Calls to `animate` are expected to be\n * used within {\\@link sequence an animation sequence}, {\\@link group group}, or {\\@link transition\n * transition}.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:\n *\n * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional\n * delay and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`\n * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,\n * delay=100, easing=ease-out`.\n * If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the `duration` value in millisecond\n * form.\n * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {\\@link style style} or {\\@link\n * keyframes keyframes}.\n * If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected and used (this is\n * useful when\n * describing an animation step that will complete an animation by {\\@link\n * transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // various functions for specifying timing data\n * animate(500, style(...))\n * animate(\"1s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"100ms 0.5s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s ease\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)\", style(...))\n *\n * // either style() of keyframes() can be used\n * animate(500, style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * animate(500, keyframes([\n *   style({ background: \"blue\" })),\n *   style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} timing\n * @param {?=} styles\n * @return {?}\n */\nexport function animate(timing, styles) {\n    if (styles === void 0) { styles = null; }\n    var /** @type {?} */ stylesEntry = styles;\n    if (!isPresent(stylesEntry)) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ EMPTY_STYLE = {};\n        stylesEntry = new AnimationStyleMetadata([EMPTY_STYLE], 1);\n    }\n    return new AnimationAnimateMetadata(timing, stylesEntry);\n}\n/**\n * `group` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n * animation\n * DSL language.

The context for\n * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n * to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls\n * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n * as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n * be avoided if possible.\n *\n * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgFor` supports `trackBy` option.\n * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n *\n * With `<template>` element:\n *\n * ```\n * <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n *   <li>...</li>\n * </template>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n * example.\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nexport var NgFor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _viewContainer\n     * @param {?} _template\n     * @param {?} _differs\n     * @param {?} _cdr\n     */\n    function NgFor(_viewContainer, _template, _differs, _cdr) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._template = _template;\n        this._differs = _differs;\n        this._cdr = _cdr;\n        this._differ = null;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTrackBy\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._trackByFn; },\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (isDevMode() && fn != null && typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                // TODO(vicb): use a log service once there is a public one available\n                if ((console) && (console.warn)) {\n                    console.warn((\"trackBy must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn) + \". \") +\n                        \"See https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgFor-directive.html#!#change-propagation for more information.\");\n                }\n            }\n            this._trackByFn = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (value) {\n            if (value) {\n                this._template = value;\n            }\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgFor.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n            // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n            var /** @type {?} */ value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n            if (!this._differ && value) {\n                try {\n                    this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this._cdr, this.ngForTrackBy);\n                }\n                catch (e) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + getTypeNameForDebugging(value) + \"'.
